Description: We consider optimal subset selection in the setting that one needs to use only one data subset to represent the whole data set with minimum information loss, and devise a novel intersection-based criterion on selecting optimal subset, called as the FPC criterion, to handle with the optimal sub-estimator in distributed principal component analysis; That is, the FPCdpca. The philosophy of the package is described in Guo G. (2025) <doi:10.1016/j.physa.2024.130308>.
